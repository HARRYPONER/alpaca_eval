    "instruction":"How did US states get their names?",
    "output_1":"The names of U.S. states come from a variety of languages and sources. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Some states are named after indigenous people, their tribes, or words from their languages. For instance, \"Dakota\" is a Sioux word meaning \"friends\" or \"allies.\" Meanwhile, \"Illinois\" is derived from the native Illiniwek people, the state's name meaning \"tribe of superior men\" in their language.\n\n2. Some states are named after British royalty or other figures from European history, like Georgia and Virginia, which were named after King George II and Queen Elizabeth I (the \"Virgin Queen\"), respectively.\n\n3. Some states' names have Spanish origins. For instance, \"Florida\" is a Spanish word meaning \"flowery,\" and \"Nevada\" is derived from the Spanish word meaning \"snow-covered.\"\n\n4. Some states were named by explorers. For example, \"Oregon\" is thought to come from the French word \"Ouragan\" meaning \"windstorm\" or \"hurricane,\" which was used by French explorers to describe the powerful Chinook winds on the Columbia River.\n\n5. Some names are derived from locations in other countries. For instance, \"New York\" was named after the Duke of York in England, and \"New Jersey\" was named after the English Channel Island of Jersey.\n\n6. Other states have names that are descriptive of their geographical features. For example, \"Mississippi\" comes from an Algonquin word meaning \"large river,\" and \"Rhode Island\" reportedly was named by Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano who compared it to the Island of Rhodes in the Mediterranean.\n\nPlease note that this is a general overview and the origin of each state's name may have more detailed history or disputed theories.",

Massachusetts, Idaho, Illinois)\n\n- Some states are named after European places or historical figures (ex. Georgia, Maryland, Virginia) \n\n- A few states are named after physical features or resources in the area (ex. Colorado means \"colored\" in Spanish, Minnesota comes from a Dakota word meaning \"sky-tinted water\")\n\n- Several states are named in honor of royalty or political leaders (ex. Carolina for King Charles, Pennsylvania and Delaware for William Penn)\n\n- The origins of a handful of state names are disputed or unclear (ex. there are multiple theories about Kentucky, Oregon)\n\n- A number of states were named somewhat arbitrarily when territories applied for statehood (ex. Ohio, Indiana)\n\nSo in summary, a mix of native words, tributes to people, descriptions of local features, and some arbitrary choices led to the state names we know today. The specific origin story varies for each state.",

    "instruction":"Hi, my sister and her girlfriends want me to play kickball with them. Can you explain how the game is played, so they don't take advantage of me?",
    "output_1":"Sure, I'd be happy to explain the rules of kickball to you! Here's a basic rundown:\n\n1. Setup: Kickball is typically played on a field with the same layout as a baseball field, with bases at each corner of a diamond and a pitcher's mound in the middle. You'll need a rubber ball about the size of a soccer ball.\n\n2. Teams: Kickball is usually played with two teams. Each team alternates between being \"in the field\" (playing defense) and \"kicking\" (playing offense).\n\n3. Game Start: The game starts with the defensive team's pitcher rolling the ball towards the offensive team's kicker, who is standing at home plate. The kicker's job is to kick the ball and then run to first base, just like in baseball. \n\n4. Scoring: The objective for the kicking team is to have its players kick the ball and run around the bases without getting out. A run (point) is scored each time a player makes it all the way around the diamond and back to home plate. \n\n5. Getting Out: The defensive team can get the kicking team's players out by catching a kicked ball in the air (fly out), by throwing the ball and hitting a runner with it while they're not on a base (tag out), or by getting the ball to a base before the runner gets there (force out).\n\n6. Innings: The teams switch roles (from kicking to fielding, or vice versa) after three outs. After both teams have had a turn at kicking, one inning has passed. A full game of kickball usually lasts about five to nine innings, but this can vary.\n\n7. Winning: The team with the most runs at the end of the game wins.\n\nRemember, the main objective is to have fun! So even if you're not familiar with the game, just go out there and give it your best shot.",
    "generator_1":"gpt4_0613",
    "dataset":"helpful_base",
    "output_2":"Here are the basic rules for kickball:\n\n- Two teams compete, with a similar number of players on each team. One team kicks\/bats first, while the other team fields.\n\n- The pitcher rolls the ball towards home plate and the kicker attempts to kick the ball into fair territory.\n\n- After kicking, the kicker runs towards first base, then potentially additional bases if they kicked far enough. \n\n- The fielding team tries to get the runner out, either by tagging them with the ball or throwing the ball to a base before the runner gets there.\n\n- An out occurs when a kicker misses the ball, a runner is tagged by the ball, or a fielder catches the kicked ball before it touches the ground.\n\n- Teams switch between kicking and fielding after three outs. An inning consists of each team kicking once. \n\n- Runs are scored when a kicker successfully runs all the bases around to home plate.\n\n- The team with the most runs after a certain number of innings wins.\n\nSome key things to watch for:\n\n- Make sure kicks stay in fair territory between the foul lines. Foul balls are strikes. \n\n- Runners must stay on the base paths and tag up if the ball is caught. \n\n- There are often modifications for younger players, like having no stealing bases.\n\nI hope these tips help you keep up with the rules and have fun playing with your sister!

    "instruction":"How do I wrap a present neatly?",
    "output_1":"Sure, here are some steps to help you wrap a present neatly:\n\n1. Gather your materials: You will need wrapping paper, scissors, tape, and a ribbon or bow if you want to add a decorative touch.\n\n2. Measure the paper: Place your gift in the center of the wrapping paper. Make sure you have enough paper to cover all sides of your gift. It's better to overestimate than underestimate.\n\n3. Cut the paper: Once you've measured, cut your wrapping paper. If you're worried about cutting straight, try using a ruler or folding a small guideline.\n\n4. Position your gift: Place your gift upside down in the middle of the paper. This way, the seams of the wrapping paper will end up on the bottom of the present.\n\n5. Fold and tape: First, fold one side of the paper over the gift and tape it down. Then, fold the other side over and tape it down too. Try to keep your folds as tight as possible to the box for a neat look.\n\n6. Fold the ends: Now you'll take care of the ends of the gift. Push the sides in, creating two flaps, then fold these flaps down against the box, creating a neat triangle at the top and bottom.\n\n7. Tape the ends: Fold the top flap down against the box and tape it. Then fold the bottom flap up and tape it. Repeat this on the other end of the gift.\n\n8. Add finishing touches: Add a bow or ribbon for a festive touch. You can also add a gift tag or small card if you like.\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect. The more you wrap, the better you'll get at it.",
    "generator_1":"gpt4_0613",
    "dataset":"helpful_base",
    "output_2":"Here are some tips for wrapping a present neatly:\n\n- Use wrapping paper that is slightly larger than the gift. It's easier to neatly wrap a present if the paper extends several inches beyond the edges of the gift on all sides.\n\n- Before you wrap, neatly fold any loose flaps and tape them down on boxes. This will give you flat, even surfaces to wrap.\n\n- Place the gift in the center of the paper and pull the paper up around it. Hold the paper in place with one hand while you cut the paper with the other hand. Leave enough excess paper to fully cover the gift.\n\n- Fold the edges of the paper neatly at the corners and tape them in place. Try to make the folds as clean and even as possible.\n\n- For a very neat look, carefully make creases at the edges and folds of the paper using the edge of a ruler.\n\n- Use double sided tape to neatly secure the edges and seams instead of regular tape. This gives a cleaner look. \n\n- To hide taped edges, fold the last 1-2 inches of wrapping paper over itself and tape to the inside of the gift wrap. \n\n- Curl ribbon with the edge of scissors before taping it on for a curly q look.\n\n- Finish with neatly placed gift tags, bows or other embellishments. Simple is best for a clean, polished look.\n\nThe key is to work slowly, fold the paper precisely, and tape the seams and edges very neatly. Taking a bit of extra time results in a beautifully wrapped present.",

    "instruction":"How do I dice without slicing my finger",
    "output_1":"Here are some steps to dice safely without slicing your finger:\n\n1. Use a sharp knife: A dull knife is more likely to slip and cause an accident. Always make sure your knife is sharp and in good condition.\n\n2. Proper grip: Hold the knife correctly. Your index and thumb should be gripping the blade, while the rest of your fingers are wrapped around the handle. This gives you better control over the knife.\n\n3. Stabilize the cutting board: Make sure your cutting board doesn't slip while you're using it. You can place a damp cloth under it to help keep it steady.\n\n4. Hold the food properly: Use the \"claw\" grip to hold the food. This means your fingers should be tucked under so the knife hits your knuckles, not your fingertips.\n\n5. Cut a flat surface: If the food is round, cut a small slice off to create a flat surface. This will stop it from rolling.\n\n6. Use a slicing motion: Do not try to force the knife down. Instead, use a forward and downward motion, allowing the knife to do the work.\n\n7. Take your time: Do not rush. Going slowly and carefully is the best way to avoid accidents. \n\n8. Practice: The more you practice, the better and safer you'll become.\n\nRemember, safety is always the priority in the kitchen.",

    "output_2":"Here are some tips for safely dicing without slicing your fingers:\n\n- Use a sharp knife. A dull knife requires more pressure and is more likely to slip. Sharpen your knives regularly.\n\n- Curl your fingers inwards when holding food to dice. Keep the tips of your fingers tucked in behind the knuckles, out of the way of the knife blade.\n\n- Cut on a stable, flat surface at a comfortable height. Use a cutting board that doesn't slide around.\n\n- Go slowly and focus. Rushing with a knife leads to accidents. Take your time.\n\n- Hold the food firmly with your other hand, keeping your fingers out of the way. Use a claw grip if needed.\n\n- Make vertical cuts first, then horizontal. This prevents slippery food from shooting out from under the knife. \n\n- Keep the knife perpendicular to the cutting board while cutting. Don't slice at an angle.\n\n- Wipe the knife blade clean frequently so food doesn't stick to it.\n\n- Store knives properly in a block or sheath. Don't leave them lying around.\n\n- Consider using a cut-resistant glove on your non-knife hand for extra protection.\n\n- Stop cutting if you feel tired or distracted. Take a break before continuing.\n\n- Learn basic knife skills and cutting techniques through videos or classes. Experience helps.\n\nStay focused, go slow, and keep your fingers clear of the blade.

    "output_1":"Sure, I'd be happy to help. Here's a step-by-step recipe for Kubdari, a traditional Georgian stuffed bread:\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nFor the Dough:\n- 500 grams of flour\n- 250 ml of warm water\n- 1 teaspoon of salt\n- 1 teaspoon of sugar\n- 7 grams of dry yeast\n\nFor the Filling:\n- 500 grams of mixed beef and pork\n- 1 large onion\n- 2 cloves of garlic\n- 1 teaspoon of ground coriander\n- 1 teaspoon of dried dill\n- 1 teaspoon of ground caraway\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Prepare the dough:** In a large bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes to activate the yeast.\n\n2. Add the flour and salt to the yeast mixture. Knead the dough until it's smooth and elastic. This should take about 10 minutes. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour. Once done, cover the bowl with a damp cloth and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.\n\n3. **Prepare the filling:** While the dough is rising, finely chop the onion and garlic. Combine the beef and pork in a large bowl. Add the chopped onion, garlic, coriander, dill, caraway, and salt and pepper. Mix until well combined.\n\n4. After the dough has risen, divide it into 4 equal pieces. Roll out each piece on a floured surface until it's about 1\/2 cm thick.\n\n5. Place a quarter of the meat filling in the center of each rolled-out piece of dough. Gather the edges of the dough to the center, pinching them together to seal the filling inside. You should end up with a round, stuffed ball of dough.\n\n6. Preheat your oven to 200 degrees Celsius (392 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\n7. Carefully flatten each ball of dough with your hands, making sure to evenly distribute the filling inside. The bread should be about 1 cm thick.\n\n8. Bake the Kubdari in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown.\n\n9. Once baked, remove the Kubdari from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy this delicious Georgian dish!\n\nRemember, the key to a great Kubdari is the filling. Feel free to experiment with different herbs and spices to fine-tune the flavor to your liking.",

Fill the pocket with the meat mixture, pressing it in tightly. Replace the top of the bread and pinch the edges closed.\n\n5. Place the kubdari on a baking sheet and bake for 25-30 minutes, until the bread is golden brown. \n\n6. Let cool slightly before slicing and serving. The kubdari can also be made with pie dough instead of bread. Just fill the unbaked pie crust with the meat mixture and bake as directed.\n\nI hope you and your guests enjoy this savory, meaty Georgian bread! Let me know if you need any other recipes.",

    "instruction":"do you think retinoid is effective on removing the acne? because I have a lot of it",
    "output_1":"Yes, retinoids can be quite effective in treating acne. They work by promoting skin cell turnover and reducing the likelihood of pores getting clogged. However, their effectiveness can vary from person to person, and they may cause side effects like dryness, peeling, and sensitivity to sunlight. It's important to start off slowly with retinoids to see how your skin reacts. It is also best to consult with a dermatologist or healthcare provider before starting any new skincare treatment.",
    "generator_1":"gpt4_0613",
    "dataset":"helpful_base",
    "output_2":"Here are a few key points about using retinoids for acne treatment:\n\n- Retinoids like tretinoin, adapalene, and tazarotene are vitamin A derivatives that can be very effective at treating acne. They help unclog pores, reduce inflammation, and increase skin cell turnover.\n\n- Retinoids work by reducing the oil production of the sebaceous glands and preventing dead skin cells from clogging pores. This helps prevent and treat acne lesions. \n\n- Retinoids come in various strengths and formulations including gels, creams and solutions. Stronger retinoids require a prescription, while some low-strength versions are available over-the-counter.\n\n- When starting a retinoid, it's common to experience side effects like skin irritation, dryness, peeling and redness. This usually improves with continued use as the skin adjusts. Using a gentle moisturizer can help.\n\n- Results may take 6-12 weeks of consistent use to see improvement. Retinoids need to be used continuously to keep acne at bay. Stopping treatment usually results in acne coming back.\n\n- Retinoids make the skin more sensitive to sunlight. It's essential to use sunscreen daily when using them.\n\nSo in summary, yes retinoids can be very beneficial for clearing up acne, especially more severe or stubborn cases. Patience and persistence are needed to get the full effects. Working with a dermatologist is recommended to get a properly formulated prescription strength retinoid.",

    "instruction":"I'm trying to teach myself to have nicer handwriting. Can you help?",
    "output_1":"Of course, I'd be happy to help you improve your handwriting. Here are a few tips and strategies:\n\n1. **Understand the basics**: Learn about the different styles of handwriting like print, cursive, and calligraphy. Choose one that you are comfortable with or that you'd like to learn.\n\n2. **Get the right tools**: The right pen can make a lot of difference. Consider trying a variety of pens to see which ones you like best. Generally, pens that aren't too inky and have a good grip are the best for handwriting.\n\n3. **Posture and grip**: Ensure you're sitting up straight and not slouching. Hold the pen correctly. Your grip shouldn't be too tight or too loose. \n\n4. **Practice**: This is the most important part. Start by tracing or copying letters and sentences. There are many handwriting practice sheets available online that you can print.\n\n5. **Consistency**: Aim for consistency in your letters and words. This includes maintaining consistent spacing between letters and words and keeping the size of your letters consistent.\n\n6. **Slow down**: If you're used to writing quickly, this could be contributing to messy handwriting. Take your time with each letter and word until you get more comfortable.\n\n7. **Patience**: Don't be hard on yourself if progress seems slow. It takes time to break old habits and form new ones. Just keep practicing a little bit every day.\n\n8. **Warm-up**: Just like any other workout, your hand and fingers might need a warm-up. Before you start writing, do some simple exercises like opening and closing your hand, and wiggling your fingers.\n\nRemember, improving handwriting is a gradual process and practice is key. Good luck!",
    "generator_1":"gpt4_0613",
    "dataset":"helpful_base",
    "output_2":"Here are some tips that may help improve your handwriting:\n\n- Use good posture and hold the pen correctly. Sit up straight and hold the pen between your thumb and index finger. Keep your grip loose.\n\n- Go slower. Don't rush through writing. Take your time and focus on forming each letter precisely. \n\n- Practice basic strokes. Work on consistent shapes and sizes of circles, lines, curves. Master these before writing full letters.\n\n- Use your arm, not just your fingers. Move your entire arm when writing, not just your fingers. This allows you to write with your larger muscles.\n\n- Find a comfortable writing size. Write in a size that is easy for you to manage and control. Larger letters can be easier than tiny ones.\n\n- Be consistent with slant. Pick a slant (left or right) and stick to it. Keep the angle of your letters consistent.\n\n- Use guide lines. Use ruled paper or create your own guide lines to keep your writing straight and evenly spaced.\n\n- Reference good models. Find examples of handwriting you admire and try to emulate the style.\n\n- Practice, practice, practice. Frequent, repeated practice sessions will help train your hand muscles and improve muscle memory. \n\n- Relax your grip. Don't squeeze the pen too tightly. This can cause tension and uneven strokes.\n\nThe most important things are going slow, proper positioning, and lots of practice. Be patient with yourself as you work to improve!",

    "output_1":"The tradition of eating turkey on Thanksgiving actually has its roots in the 'First Thanksgiving' in 1621 when the Pilgrims and Wampanoag tribe shared a meal together. While there is no exact menu recorded from that feast, letters from Pilgrim chroniclers suggest that wildfowl was part of the meal, which could have included turkeys. \n\nHowever, it wasn't until the 19th century that turkey became the go-to centerpiece of Thanksgiving meals. This was largely promoted by Sarah Josepha Hale, an influential writer and editor who campaigned for Thanksgiving to become a national holiday. She published recipes and wrote about Thanksgiving traditions, often including a turkey.  \n\nFinally, turkeys are native to North America and were readily available, making them a practical choice as well. They were also large enough to feed a big group, and unlike cows or chickens, they weren't needed for milk or eggs.",
    "generator_1":"gpt4_0613",
    "dataset":"helpful_base",
    "output_2":"Here are a few reasons why turkeys became the traditional centerpiece of Thanksgiving meals in the United States:\n\n- Turkey was abundant and easy to find in the wild in many parts of North America where early Thanksgiving celebrations took place. It was a practical food source for large gatherings.\n\n- Wild turkeys are native to North America, so serving turkey was a way to symbolize and give thanks for the new land that early settlers were living in. \n\n- Turkeys are large birds that can feed a lot of people, which made them a practical choice for large feasts. A large turkey can feed over a dozen people easily.\n\n- By the 1600s, turkey farming was common in many parts of New England, increasing their availability for Thanksgiving.\n\n- When Abraham Lincoln declared Thanksgiving a national holiday in 1863, turkey was already associated with Thanksgiving traditions, cementing its role as the customary main course of Thanksgiving meals.\n\nSo in summary, the turkey's abundance, symbolism, and ability to feed crowds made it the natural centerpiece for early Thanksgiving celebrations that then became enshrined as the traditional main course of the holiday feast.",

    "instruction":"Hi, I'm interested in learning to play badminton. Can you explain the game to me?",
    "output_1":"Absolutely, I'd be happy to explain the game of badminton to you!\n\nBadminton is a racquet sport played by either two opposing players (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles), who take positions on opposite halves of a rectangular court divided by a net. The objective is to hit the shuttlecock, also known as a birdie, with your racquet so that it passes over the net and lands in the opponent's half of the court.\n\nHere are some basic rules and guidelines:\n\n1. **Start of Play**: The game starts with a coin toss. Whoever wins the toss can decide whether to serve or receive first or they can choose which side of the court they wish to start from.\n\n2. **Serving**: When serving, the shuttlecock must be hit in an upward direction, with the server's racquet always initially starting below the waist. The shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce, as in tennis.\n\n3. **Scoring**: A rally is won when a player or pair hits the shuttlecock so it lands in the opponent's court without being returned. Points can also be scored if the opponent commits a fault, such as hitting the shuttlecock into or under the net, hitting it out of bounds, or failing to hit it before it hits the floor in their half of the court. \n\n4. **Game and Match**: A match consists of the best of 3 games of 21 points. Every time there is a serve, a point is scored. The side winning a rally adds a point to its score. At 20 all, the side which gains a 2 point lead first, wins that game. At 29 all, the side scoring the 30th point, wins that game. \n\n5. **Change of Ends**: The players change ends at the end of a game. In the third game, they change ends when the leading score reaches 11.\n\n6. **Singles and Doubles Play**: In singles, the server starts from the right service court if their score is zero or even, and the left service court if their score is odd. In doubles, if the serving side wins a rally, the same server serves again from the alternate service court. \n\nThose are the very basics of badminton. As you get more into it, you will learn more about the strategies, different types of shots, and more complex rules. It's a very fun and engaging sport that requires agility, speed, strength, and strategic thinking. Enjoy learning!",

    "output_2":"Sure, here's a quick overview of badminton:\n\n- Badminton is a racquet sport that is played by either two opposing players (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles). The aim is to hit the shuttlecock (also called a birdie) back and forth across the net and try to make your opponent miss.\n\n- The court is rectangular and divided in half by a net. Courts are usually indoors, but outdoor courts exist too. The singles court is narrower than the doubles court.\n\n- Players use racquets strung with tight strings to hit the shuttlecock. The shuttlecock has an open conical shape and consists of a feather or plastic skirt attached to a rounded cork base. \n\n- The game starts with one side serving diagonally across the net to the opponent. The shuttlecock must be hit below waist height on the serve. After the serve, players can hit the shuttlecock from any position on their side of the court.\n\n- Points are scored when one side fails to return the shuttlecock back over the net. A shuttlecock touching the net on a serve also results in a point for the opponent. Games are played to 21 points.\n\n- Key skills in badminton are the overhead clear shot, the fast drop shot, the smash, and quick reflexes at the net. Strategy involves using deception, variety, and control of the shuttlecock to move your opponent around.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the basics of badminton!",

    "instruction":"Do you know why cats always rub up against your legs?",
    "output_1":"Yes, cats rub up against your legs for several reasons. One primary reason is to mark their territory. Cats have scent glands in different parts of their bodies including their cheeks, tails, and flanks, and they use them to leave their scent on you. Rubbing against your legs is their way of telling other cats that you belong to them. \n\nAlso, cats use this behavior to show affection and to seek attention. They might want to be petted, played with, or fed. Lastly, it can also be a form of greeting, similar to a friendly hello.",
    "generator_1":"gpt4_0613",
    "dataset":"helpful_base",
    "output_2":"There are a few possible reasons why cats rub up against people's legs:\n\n- Scent marking - Cats have scent glands on their faces, tails, and feet. When they rub against objects or people, they are depositing their scent as a way to mark territory and feel more secure. Rubbing against legs leaves their scent on you and lets other cats know you belong to them.\n\n- Affection - For cats, rubbing is a way to show affection and bond with their preferred humans. Cats see legs and feet as part of their human friends, so rubbing up against them is a sign of trust and a greeting.\n\n- Attention seeking - Cats often rub against legs as a way to get your attention. It's a simple, non-vocal way for them to say \"hey, don't forget about me, I'm here!\" especially around feeding time or when they want pets.\n\n- Texture - Cat legs have scent glands so rubbing against a human leg transfers their scents. But they also just seem to enjoy the texture of human clothes and skin as something pleasing to rub up against. The sensation and motion may also help remove loose hair.\n\nSo in summary, scent marking, affection, attention seeking, and enjoyment of texture are main reasons why cats rub up against human legs and feet. It's a natural cat behavior that shows they are comfortable with their human friends.",

    "instruction":"I am going to try to roast a pig at home for Thanksgiving this year. What equipment and techniques do I need to successfully get a pig roasted?",
    "output_1":"Roasting a whole pig is quite a project, but with the right equipment and techniques, it can be a rewarding and delicious experience. Here is a general guideline:\n\nEquipment:\n\n1. **Roasting Box or Spit**: Also known as a 'Caja China' or 'La Caja Asadora', this is an insulated box where you can roast your pig. It can be bought online or at specialist stores. Alternatively, you can rent or build one yourself. A spit is another option, although it's more labor-intensive as it requires constant turning.\n\n2. **Charcoal**: You'll need a good amount of charcoal to maintain the heat for several hours. The exact amount depends on the size of the pig and the type of roasting box or spit you are using.\n\n3. **Meat Thermometer**: This is essential for ensuring the pig is cooked to the safe and correct internal temperature.\n\n4. **Marinating Syringe**: This is used to inject your pig with a marinade to enhance flavor.\n\n5. **Long-Handled Tongs and Heat Resistant Gloves**: To handle hot coals and the pig.\n\nTechniques:\n\n1. **Choosing the Pig**: The size of the pig will depend on the number of guests. Generally, 1 pound per person is a good estimate. Ensure the pig is completely defrosted and fits into your roasting box or spit.\n\n2. **Preparation and Marinating**: Clean the pig thoroughly. Inject the pig with a marinade a day before roasting. You can also rub the pig with a spice rub.\n\n3. **Roasting**: Place the pig in the roasting box or on the spit. If using a box, place the charcoal on top. If using a spit, the pig should be placed over the charcoal. It's best to have indirect heat. \n\n4. **Cooking Time**: This varies depending on the size of the pig and the heat of the coals. A general rule of thumb is about 4-6 hours for a 50-60 pound pig. The internal temperature should reach 160-170\u00b0F in the thickest part of the shoulder and the ham.\n\n5. **Resting and Carving**: Let the pig rest for about 20 minutes before carving. This allows the juices to redistribute.\n\nRemember, roasting a pig is an all-day event. Start early, maintain a consistent heat, and most importantly, have fun with it! It's a great event to share with friends and family.",
    "generator_1":"gpt4_0613",
    "dataset":"helpful_base",
    "output_2":"Here are some tips for roasting a pig at home for Thanksgiving:\n\n- Get a roasting box or rotisserie. This will allow you to roast the pig evenly by rotating it over a heat source. Look for one designed for roasting whole pigs.\n\n- You'll need a heat source. Options include a propane burner, charcoal grill, or digging a pit and lining it with bricks or metal sheets to make a DIY pig roasting box. \n\n- Prepare a basting mixture. A simple mix of olive oil, salt, pepper, and herbs works well. Have plenty on hand to baste the pig frequently as it roasts.\n\n- Plan for 15-20 lbs per person if the pig is the main course. A 60-100 lb pig should serve a smaller group of 4-6 people. \n\n- Place the pig on its belly in the roasting box, and truss it - tie the legs and arms inwards so it holds its shape. \n\n- Insert a meat thermometer to monitor the internal temp. Roast until the thickest part of the meat reaches 185\u00b0F. This will take 4-8 hours depending on the size. \n\n- Rotate the pig and baste every 30 mins to ensure even cooking. Add more charcoal or wood to maintain heat. \n\n- Let the pig rest for 30 mins before carving. Be sure to have plenty of help carving and serving the pig!\n\nThe key is low and slow roasting with constant rotation and basting. Give yourself plenty of time and preparation for a whole pig roast.",

Organic matter should make up less than 20-30% of the soil mix.\n\n- Soil pH should be slightly acidic, around 6.0-6.5. Avoid alkaline soils.\n\n- Make sure the soil mix provides nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium but don't over-fertilize. Cacti are adapted to low-nutrient soils.\n\n- Commercial cactus\/succulent soil mixes are available if you don't want to mix your own. Just check the ingredients to make sure it's fast draining. \n\n- Consider adding a top dressing of gravel, stones, or grit to improve drainage and discourage rot.\n\nThe key is to provide a very porous, well-draining soil that will not stay wet for long after watering.

    "output_1":"The Northern Lights, also known as Aurora Borealis, are caused by collisions between gaseous particles in the Earth's atmosphere and charged particles released from the sun's atmosphere. The variations in color are due to the type of gas particles that are colliding. The most common auroral color, a pale yellowish-green, is produced by oxygen molecules located about 60 miles above Earth. Rare, all-red auroras are produced by high-altitude oxygen, at heights of up to 200 miles. Nitrogen produces blue or purplish-red aurora.",

    "dataset":"helpful_base",
    "output_2":"The northern lights, also known as the aurora borealis, are caused by collisions between gaseous particles in the Earth's atmosphere and charged particles from the sun's atmosphere. Here's a more detailed explanation:\n\n- The sun's atmosphere is constantly emitting a stream of charged particles, mainly electrons and protons, which is known as the solar wind. \n\n- When these charged particles interact with the Earth's magnetic field, they are deflected toward the magnetic poles of the Earth. \n\n- As the charged particles enter the upper atmosphere, they collide with atoms and molecules of gas, mainly oxygen and nitrogen. These collisions cause the atoms to become excited.\n\n- When the excited atoms return to their normal state, they release energy in the form of light. This causes the colorful glowing lights of the aurora.\n\n- The colors depend on which atom is colliding. Oxygen gives off green and red light, while nitrogen glows blue and purple.\n\n- Auroras are more visible at high latitudes because the magnetic field lines directing the solar particles to the poles converge at the north and south poles. So the particle interactions are most frequent and concentrated in the sky above the Arctic and Antarctic.\n\nSo in summary, the solar wind sends charged particles to Earth's atmosphere, which excites atmospheric gases to emit the beautiful lights of the aurora.",

    "instruction":"Why is kobe beef so damn expensive?",
    "output_1":"Kobe beef is so expensive due to a number of factors:\n\n1. Limited Supply: Kobe beef comes from a specific breed of cattle, known as Tajima-Gyu, which are reared under strict conditions in the Hyogo Prefecture of Japan. Only about 3,000 of these are certified as Kobe beef annually, making it a very rare commodity.\n\n2. High Quality Standards: The meat is graded on a strict Japanese Beef Marbling Score (BMS) from 1-12, with a score of 12 being the best. To qualify as Kobe, the meat must score a 6 or above. This high standard ensures that only the best meat is classified as Kobe beef.\n\n3. Exceptional Flavor and Texture: Kobe beef is renowned for its flavor, tenderness, and well-marbled texture. The cattle are fed a special diet and are often given beer to stimulate appetite. Some are even massaged to ensure the fat is distributed evenly in the muscle tissue, contributing to its unique taste and tenderness.\n\n4. Export Restrictions: Until 2012, export of Kobe beef from Japan was banned. The ban has since been lifted, but there are still very strict regulations and high costs associated with exporting, making it more expensive outside of Japan.\n\n5. Reputation and Branding: Kobe beef has a luxury status and is often associated with high-end dining experiences. This reputation allows for a higher price point.",
    "generator_1":"gpt4_0613",
    "dataset":"helpful_base",
    "output_2":"There are a few key reasons why Kobe beef is so expensive:\n\n- Exclusivity - Kobe beef comes from a very small region in Japan and only about 3,000 head of cattle qualify as \"Kobe\" per year. The strict regulations and small amount of cattle mean the supply is extremely limited.\n\n- Breeding & Care - Kobe cattle are descendants of Tajima-Gyu breed and are raised with extreme care. Their diet is closely controlled and includes large amounts of beer and massage. This intensive breeding and rearing adds to the costs.\n\n- Marbling - Kobe beef is highly prized for its intense marbling or fat content. The intricate web of fat makes the beef extremely tender and flavorful. Achieving this marbling requires specialized breeding and feeding over long periods of time. \n\n- Demand - As one of the most renowned luxury foods in the world, there is tremendous demand globally for authentic Kobe beef. Limited supply and high demand leads to astronomical prices.\n\n- Import Costs - Most Kobe beef is exported from Japan which also adds to the costs. Transportation, special processing, and import duties all make the beef more expensive by the time it reaches foreign markets.\n\nSo in summary, the incredibly meticulous breeding, strict regulations, limited supply, and high global demand contribute to Kobe beef's astronomical prices compared to conventional beef. The time, care and rarity involved in producing it get reflected in the final retail cost.",

    "instruction":"What exactly causes volcanoes to form?",
    "output_1":"Volcanoes form when there is an opening in the Earth's crust that allows molten rock, also known as magma, to reach the surface. This can occur in several ways:\n\n1. Plate Tectonics: Most volcanoes form at the boundaries of Earth's tectonic plates, which are large sections of the Earth's lithosphere that move in different directions. When these plates collide, one plate often subducts, or slides under the other, leading to the formation of volcanoes.\n\n   a) Convergent Boundaries: These are areas where tectonic plates are colliding or moving towards each other. The subducted plate goes deeper into the Earth's mantle where it melts, forming magma that rises to the surface and creates a volcano.\n\n   b) Divergent Boundaries: These are areas where tectonic plates are separating or moving away from each other. This leads to gaps which allow magma to rise up and form a volcano.\n\n2. Hot Spots: Volcanoes can also form away from plate boundaries in places known as hot spots. Hot spots are areas where magma from deep within the Earth's mantle melts through the crust and reaches the surface.\n\nIn both cases, the magma that reaches the surface cools and solidifies, gradually building up a volcano over time.",
    "generator_1":"gpt4_0613",
    "dataset":"helpful_base",
    "output_2":"Volcanoes form due to processes within the Earth's mantle and crust. Here are some key factors that lead to volcano formation:\n\n- Plate tectonics - Movement of the Earth's tectonic plates leads to areas where magma can rise up through cracks and weaknesses in the crust. Subduction zones, where two plates collide and one dives beneath the other, are common volcanic areas.\n\n- Hotspots - Plumes of hot mantle material rise and melt through the crust, creating volcanoes at the surface. Hawaii's volcanoes form over a hotspot.\n\n- Magma production - Partial melting in the mantle produces magma that can rise up and erupt at the surface. This melting can occur at plate boundaries or over hotspots.\n\n- Magma pathways - Magma rises through cracks and conduits in the crust. The magma collects in reservoirs beneath volcanoes, applying pressure until it erupts.\n\n- Volatile gases - Gases like water vapor and carbon dioxide dissolved in magma lower its melting point, aiding eruption. Gas pressure builds up as magma rises.\n\n- Earth's internal heat - Heat from radioactive decay, friction, and residual heat from the Earth's formation drives mantle convection, melting, and volcanism.\n\nSo in summary, internal Earth processes drive melting, magma production, and pathways to the surface that allow volcanoes to form and erupt. Plate tectonics focuses and enhances volcanic activity in certain areas like subduction zones.",

    "output_2":"Here are some key facts about the colonization of Canada:\n\n- The first European colonization of what would become Canada began in the 16th century with French settlers establishing colonies in Acadia and the St. Lawrence River valley. Jacques Cartier made the first European claim for France in 1534. \n\n- Samuel de Champlain established the first permanent European settlement at Quebec City in 1608. This was the beginning of New France, the French colonies that would become part of Canada.\n\n- The British began establishing colonies in Canada in the early 17th century, with settlements in Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island. \n\n- The British defeated the French in the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), taking control of most of France's North American colonies. In 1763 France ceded nearly all of New France to Britain.\n\n- Britain's Quebec Act of 1774 granted recognition and rights to the French-speaking population of Quebec, helping to keep them loyal during the American Revolution.\n\n- Between 1783-1867 Britain would unify its Canadian colonies into the Province of Canada and eventually the Dominion of Canada in 1867, an autonomous federation with self-governing powers. This is considered the beginning of an independent Canada.\n\nSo in summary, Canada was colonized beginning in the early 16th century by France and Britain, with Britain ultimately gaining control over the territory by the late 18th century.

    "instruction":"How did mankind discover that the earth was spherical, and why did they initially believe it to be flat?",
    "output_1":"The belief that the Earth was flat is a historical misconception. Many ancient cultures, including the ancient Greeks, had a complex understanding of the world's shape. The idea of a spherical Earth was proposed by ancient Greek philosophy in the 6th century BC and was later espoused by Pythagoras. Parmenides and later Plato also supported this idea.\n\nThe Greeks had a few reasons to believe the Earth was a sphere. One of the earliest and most significant pieces of evidence was the Earth's shadow on the moon during a lunar eclipse, which is always round. Also, as travelers moved north or south, they saw different stars, suggesting they were moving over the surface of a sphere.\n\nEratosthenes, a Greek mathematician and astronomer, made a notably accurate calculation of the Earth's circumference in 240 BC. He knew that at noon on the summer solstice in the city of Syene (now Aswan, Egypt), the sun was directly overhead because it illuminated the bottom of a deep well. Meanwhile, in Alexandria, it was observed to be at an angle to the vertical. By measuring this angle, and knowing the distance between the two cities, Eratosthenes was able to calculate the Earth's circumference using simple geometry.\n\nAs to why people initially believed the Earth to be flat, this may be largely because it appears that way in local observation. Without a wider perspective, it's not readily apparent that the Earth has a curved shape. Additionally, early peoples' understanding of the world was often based on religious or cultural beliefs, rather than scientific evidence.",
    "generator_1":"gpt4_0613",
    "dataset":"helpful_base",
    "output_2":"There are a few key reasons why ancient civilizations originally believed the Earth was flat:\n\n- It appears flat from most perspectives when standing on the ground. The curvature of the Earth is subtle and hard to detect without aerial views.\n\n- Lack of knowledge about astronomy and the planet's place in the solar system. Ancient cultures did not have a broad understanding of the cosmos to conceptualize Earth's shape.\n\n- Limited geography\/travel. Most people only traveled small areas, so it was difficult to gather evidence the Earth was spherical.\n\nSome of the developments that led to the realization the Earth is spherical:\n\n- Observation of ships sailing over the horizon. The mast disappears last, suggesting the surface curves.\n\n- Lunar eclipses. The shape of the Earth's shadow on the moon during eclipses is round.\n\n- Differences in constellations. Constellations in the sky change as one travels north to south, suggesting a curved surface. \n\n- Circumnavigation. As people began sailing all the way around the Earth, it became clear it was a sphere.\n\n- Seeing Earth from space. Modern space travel and photography provided direct evidence of a spherical Earth.\n\nSo improved astronomy, geography, and travel helped scientists gather evidence that the intuitive flat Earth theory was incorrect. Careful observations and data eventually overturned the earlier perspective.",

    "instruction":"Why did humans evolve to believe in God?",
    "output_1":"The belief in God or a higher power is a complex phenomenon that is intertwined with various aspects of human evolution, psychology and sociology. Here are some perspectives:\n\n1. Cognitive Evolution: One theory is that as humans evolved, our cognitive abilities developed, leading us to question the world and our place in it. This may have led to the belief in a higher power or god as an explanation for things that were beyond our understanding.\n\n2. Sociocultural Evolution: Belief in a god or gods may have served to reinforce social cohesion and group unity, which would have been beneficial for survival. If a group of people believe in the same deity, they are more likely to work together for common goals, follow similar rules, and support each other.\n\n3. Psychological Comfort: Belief in God can provide psychological comfort and a sense of purpose in life. It can help people cope with uncertainty and fear, and provide a moral framework for behavior. \n\n4. Existential Questions: Humans have the unique ability to contemplate their own mortality and the meaning of life. Belief in God or an afterlife can provide answers to these existential questions.\n\n5. Pattern Recognition: Humans are pattern-seeking creatures, and we often see patterns even where none exist - a phenomenon known as pareidolia. This attribute might have led early humans to attribute unexplained events or natural phenomena to the actions of gods.\n\n6. Moral Framework: Belief in God often comes with a set of moral and ethical guidelines which can help maintain social order and promote cooperation.\n\nIt's important to note that these are theories and may not apply to everyone. People's personal beliefs can be influenced by a wide range of factors, including their upbringing, personal experiences, and individual thought processes.",

For example, our tendency to see intent and patterns even in random events may lead to beliefs in supernatural entities.\n\n- Adaptation theories propose that religious beliefs and behaviors evolved because they conferred survival or reproductive benefits to early human groups. Beliefs that encouraged cooperation and cohesion may have been advantageous.\n\n- Attachment theory suggests human reliance on caregivers early in life predisposes us to seek comfort and protection from powerful guardians, which could manifest as belief in spiritual figures. \n\n- Existential theory argues that beliefs providing relief from existential anxiety, such as fears of death and meaninglessness, would be naturally selected for. Belief in god(s) and afterlives could serve this function.\n\n- Social theory suggests shared religious beliefs bind groups together and allow the formation of large cooperative societies crucial for human evolutionary success. \n\nThere is no scientific consensus on which theory best explains the near universal tendency toward religious belief in humans. It likely arises from a combination of cognitive biases, emotional needs, and social dynamics that promoted survival in our evolutionary past. But the exact origins continue to be debated.",

Logs: Traditional log cabins are built with large, round logs. These can be very durable and offer a classic, rustic look. However, they require regular maintenance to prevent decay.\n\n2. Wood: If you want a more modern look, you can use lumber to build your cabin. This is typically less expensive than logs and easier to work with. You can choose from a variety of types of wood such as pine, cedar, or oak.\n\n3. Stone: Stone cabins can be very sturdy and long-lasting. They also offer a unique, natural look. However, building with stone can be more challenging and expensive than other materials.\n\n4. Metal: Metal cabins can be durable and relatively low-maintenance. They can also be more modern and sleek in design. \n\n5. Straw Bale: Straw bale cabins can be an eco-friendly option. They are energy efficient and can be less expensive than other materials. However, they may not be as durable or long-lasting.\n\n6. Cordwood: Cordwood construction involves using short, round pieces of wood, similar to firewood, and mortar.

Over time, more and more natural explanations have been found for phenomena once attributed to God\/supernatural forces. Things like evolution, the Big Bang, etc. provide scientific explanations that make God seem unnecessary to explain origins and life.\n\n- Skepticism and critical thinking. Scientists are trained to think critically and skeptically, requiring strong evidence before accepting a claim. The lack of definitive proof for religious supernatural claims leads many scientists to remain unconvinced.\n\n- Personal philosophy. Some scientists find the claims made by religions about God, faith, and morality to be unreasonable or illogical based on their own philosophical perspectives. Their scientific training emphasizes reason, logic, and observation as the paths to knowledge.\n\n- Not a professional focus. Most scientists focus their research on the natural world. The supernatural is outside their scope of professional interest and expertise. Unless they explore religious topics in their personal time, God\/Satan are often just not relevant to their work.\n\nOf course, there are scientists who do believe in God or other supernatural forces.

During this orbit, different portions of the moon are illuminated by the sun, creating the moon's phases. \n\nWhen the moon is in a phase where it's not directly opposite the sun from our perspective on Earth, it can be visible in the daytime. This is because the moon's illuminated side is reflecting sunlight back to Earth, and if the sky is clear and the moon is positioned high enough, we can see the moon during the day.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the moon can be easier or harder to see depending on its phase. A full moon, for example, won't be visible during the day, because a full moon rises at sunset and sets at sunrise.

We see different phases of the moon depending on the relative positions of the Earth, moon and sun. During part of its orbit, the sun illuminates the side of the moon that faces us, making it appear full. But the moon is still visible in the sky with the sun.\n\n- The moon reflects sunlight, so even when the side facing us isn't fully illuminated, we can still see the moon lit up a bit by reflected sunlight. The moon is bright enough to be seen in the daytime sky.\n\n- The moon is far enough away from Earth that its location relative to the sun and Earth allows it to be sunlit and visible to us here on Earth's surface at the same time the sun is visible. \n\n- The cycle of moon phases takes about 29.5 days, so there is usually a waxing or waning moon visible at various times of the day during that cycle. We don't only see the moon at night.\n\nSo in summary, the moon's orbit, its ability to reflect sunlight, and its distance from Earth all allow us to see the moon illuminated to some degree in our sky at times when the sun is also visible.",

    "output_1":"Julius Caesar and Cleopatra's relationship is one of the most famous romantic relationships in history, marked by power, politics, and scandal.\n\nCleopatra, the last pharaoh of Egypt, met Julius Caesar, the Roman general, in 48 BC when she smuggled herself into his palace rolled up in a carpet to ask for his assistance. At the time, she was in a power struggle with her brother, Ptolemy XIII. Caesar was captivated by her intelligence and charm, which led to a romantic and political alliance.\n\nCleopatra gave birth to a son named Caesarion (Ptolemy XV Philopator Philometor Caesar) in 47 BC, whom she claimed was Caesar's child. However, Caesar never officially acknowledged Caesarion as his son. \n\nTheir relationship had significant political implications. Cleopatra's alliance with Caesar helped her solidify her power in Egypt. For Caesar, his relationship with Cleopatra allowed him to strengthen the Roman Empire's ties to Egypt, a rich and strategic region.\n\nCleopatra visited Rome at least once, living in Caesar's villa just outside Rome, causing a scandal among the city's elite who were not used to seeing a powerful woman in such a position.\n\nIn 44 BC, Julius Caesar was assassinated. After his death, Cleopatra returned to Egypt and aligned herself with Mark Antony, Caesar's ally and friend, which is another famous historical romance.",

    "output_2":"Here are some key details about the famous romance between Julius Caesar and Cleopatra:\n\n- They first met in 48 BC when Caesar arrived in Egypt after defeating Pompey in a civil war. Cleopatra needed Caesar's support to gain control of Egypt, so she had herself smuggled into his quarters rolled up in a carpet. This daring act impressed Caesar.\n\n- Despite a 35 year age gap, they soon became lovers. Cleopatra bore Caesar a son named Caesarion in 47 BC. Caesar never officially acknowledged him, but they considered Caesarion their child. \n\n- Caesar brought Cleopatra to Rome as an honored guest. This scandalized Roman society, as Caesar was already married. But Caesar seemed enamored with Cleopatra, even erecting a golden statue of her in the temple of Venus.\n\n- After Caesar's assassination in 44 BC, Cleopatra returned to Egypt. When Mark Antony rose to power, he summoned her and they too became intimate. Cleopatra bore Antony twins.\n\n- The romance between Caesar and Cleopatra was brief but impactful. It linked perhaps the two most powerful figures in the Mediterranean world at the time, and later gave Cleopatra access to Caesar's heir Octavian. Their union also produced Caesarion, Cleopatra's co-ruler of Egypt.",

    "output_1":"Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus, known commonly as Suetonius, wrote \"The Twelve Caesars\" in the early 2nd century AD, during the reign of the Roman emperor Hadrian.\n\nSuetonius was a historian and biographer and held an administrative role in the Imperial court, giving him firsthand access to the Imperial archives and other privileged information. He wrote \"The Twelve Caesars\" as one of his significant works, providing biographical sketches of the Roman Empire's first twelve leaders, from Julius Caesar to Domitian.\n\nThe context of the time was that the Roman Empire was at its height, and the Pax Romana (Roman Peace) was in effect. This period was characterized by relative peace and stability, although it was also marked by autocracy, political manipulation, and occasional brutality by the emperors. \n\nThe work of Suetonius offers a unique perspective into the lives of these emperors, documenting not only their public deeds but also their personal habits, quirks, and vices. This made \"The Twelve Caesars\" an invaluable source of information for later historians.",
    "generator_1":"gpt4_0613",
    "dataset":"helpful_base",
    "output_2":"Here are some key points about the context when Suetonius wrote The Twelve Caesars:\n\n- Suetonius lived approximately 69-122 AD during the Roman Empire. \n\n- He served for a time as the personal secretary to the emperor Hadrian. This gave him access to the imperial archives and records, which aided his research.\n\n- The Twelve Caesars was written around 121 AD, during the reign of Hadrian. \n\n- The book covers the lives of Julius Caesar and the first 11 emperors of Rome, from Caesar himself to Domitian. Suetonius had access to important primary sources about their lives.\n\n- The Roman Empire was at its peak during this period, with relative peace and prosperity. Latin literature was flourishing.\n\n- Suetonius wrote in a biographical style that was more sensational and gossipy compared to other historians. He included many rumors, scandals, and physical details about the Caesars.\n\n- His purpose seemed to be documenting the lives of the Caesars rather than objectively judging or interpreting their reigns. He wanted to preserve imperial history.\n\nSo in summary, Suetonius wrote from a unique vantage point of access and proximity to historical imperial records during a peak period of Roman power and culture. His biography-focused style shaped how he documented the first Roman imperial dynasties in The Twelve Caesars.",

    "output_1":"Walt Disney, born Walter Elias Disney on December 5, 1901, in Chicago, Illinois, was an American entrepreneur, animator, and film producer. He is a pivotal figure in the history of animation and in the creation of entertainment parks.\n\nDisney started drawing at a young age and began his career as a commercial illustrator. His interest in animation led him to establish Laugh-O-Gram Studio in Kansas City in 1921. However, it went bankrupt in 1923. Undeterred, Disney moved to Hollywood and set up the Disney Brothers Studio with his older brother, Roy O. Disney. In 1928, they created a character named Mickey Mouse in a short film titled \"Steamboat Willie.\" It was one of the first synchronized sound cartoons and became a big hit.\n\nIn 1937, Disney produced Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the first full-length animated feature to be produced by an American studio. Its success led to other major and successful animated films like Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo, and Bambi.\n\nIn 1955, Disney realized another one of his dreams when he opened Disneyland, a massive amusement park in Anaheim, California. Later, in 1965, he began developing Disney World, a similar amusement park in Florida.\n\nDisney was a visionary and innovator. His impact on entertainment and popular culture is immeasurable. He won 22 Academy Awards during his lifetime, and in 1960, he was honored with two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, for his contributions to both motion pictures and television.\n\nWalt Disney passed away on December 15, 1966, from lung cancer but his legacy continues to live on. The Walt Disney Company is now one of the largest and best-known studios in Hollywood. Disney World, opened in 1971, and Disneyland are major tourist destinations. His influence on entertainment, animation, and amusement parks is still felt today.",

His family moved to a farm near Marceline, Missouri when he was young, which is where Walt developed his love for drawing. \n\n- In 1919, Walt moved to Kansas City where he met Ub Iwerks and they started a small animation business together. This marked the beginning of Walt's animation career.\n\n- In 1923, Walt left Kansas City for Hollywood with his brother Roy. They founded the Disney Brothers Studio and created the Alice Comedies series. \n\n- In 1928, Mickey Mouse was created and starred in the first synchronized sound cartoon, Steamboat Willie. This launched Walt to huge success. \n\n- Throughout the 1930s, Walt pushed animation boundaries with innovative films like Flowers and Trees (first Technicolor cartoon), The Three Little Pigs, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (first full-length animated feature film).\n\n- In the 1940s, Walt diversified into live-action films and nature documentaries. He also produced propaganda and training films for the military during WWII. \n\n- In the 1950s, Walt pioneered television with shows like Disneyland and The Mickey Mouse Club. He also opened Disneyland in 1955, the first Disney theme park.\n\n- Walt and his team continued making animated and live-action films through the 1960s until his death in 1966. After his death, the studio continued to produce innovative animated films and expand its theme park business worldwide.",

    "instruction":"Can you help me figure out how to sew a button on a shirt?",
    "output_1":"Absolutely! Here's a simple step-by-step guide for you:\n\nMaterials you'll need:\n1. Thread (matching the color of the existing buttons or fabric)\n2. Needle\n3. Replacement button\n4. Scissors\n\nSteps:\n1. Thread the Needle: Cut about 24 inches of thread and push one end through the eye of the needle. Pull it through until you have two equal lengths of thread. Tie the ends together in a knot.\n\n2. Position the Button: Line up the button with the buttonhole on the opposite side of the shirt. This will ensure it's in the correct position.\n\n3. First Stitch: From the inside of the shirt, push the needle up through the fabric and one of the buttonholes. Pull it through until the knot stops it. \n\n4. Second Stitch: Push the needle down through the opposite hole and the fabric underneath. \n\n5. X or Parallel Pattern: If the button has four holes, you can choose to sew in an 'X' pattern or two parallel lines. For an 'X', repeat steps 3 and 4 with the diagonal buttonholes. For parallel lines, repeat steps 3 and 4 with the holes directly across from each other. \n\n6. Repeat: Do this process about 6 times for each set of holes to ensure the button is secure.\n\n7. Secure the Button: On your last stitch, push the needle through the fabric but not through the buttonhole, so it's between the button and the fabric. Remove the needle and wrap the thread around the base of the button a few times to create a \"shank\". This gives the button some height and allows it to fit over the edge of the buttonhole.\n\n8. Tie it Off: Push the needle back down through the fabric to the inside of the shirt. To tie off the thread, make a small loop and push the needle through it. Pull tight and repeat a couple of times to secure it. Cut off any excess thread.\n\nAnd there you go! You've successfully sewn a button on your shirt.",

Thread the needle and make a knot at the end. \n\n3. Mark the placement for the button on the shirt with a pin. Line it up with the existing buttonhole. \n\n4. Place the button where you want it and push the needle up through one of the holes in the button. \n\n5. Insert the needle back down through the opposite hole in the button.

On the underside of the fabric, knot the thread securely. Then insert the needle through the fabric only and make a few securing stitches to lock it in place.\n\n8. Cut the excess thread close to the fabric.\n\n9. Check that the button is securely stitched by pushing it back and forth. It should stay firmly in place.\n\n10.

    "instruction":"How did serial killers get away with murder for so long in the 70s and 80s?",
    "output_1":"Several factors contributed to serial killers evading capture for extended periods in the 70s and 80s. \n\n1. Lack of Technological Advancements: During the 70s and 80s, forensic technology was not as advanced as it is today. DNA profiling was not commonly used until the mid-80s. Thus, criminals left fewer traces, and even when they did, the police could not always use them effectively.\n\n2. Limited Communication Between Law Enforcement Agencies: Communication between different police departments and agencies was not as efficient or widespread as it is now. Therefore, if a serial killer was operating in multiple jurisdictions, it could take a while for patterns to be recognized.\n\n3. Absence of Data Sharing Systems: Today, law enforcement agencies have databases that help track and identify patterns in crimes. These systems were not in place or as comprehensive in the 70s and 80s, making it harder to link crimes to the same perpetrator.\n\n4. Social and Cultural Factors: Society was different in the 70s and 80s, with less awareness about serial killers and their methods. Also, hitchhiking was more common, and people often trusted strangers, making it easier for serial killers to find victims.\n\n5. Inadequate Victim Support Services: Many victims, particularly those involved in risky lifestyles (like drugs, prostitution, etc.), were less likely to be reported missing immediately or were not given the necessary attention by law enforcement.\n\n6. Skill of the Killer: Some killers were extremely clever and cautious. They often committed their crimes in different areas, did not leave obvious patterns, or successfully manipulated people to avoid suspicion.\n\n7. Insufficient Training: Many police departments were not adequately trained to identify or handle serial killers. The profiling and understanding of serial killers was still in its infancy during these decades.\n\n8. Media Influence: Media reporting on such cases was not as immediate or widespread as today. Thus, public awareness and pressure on law enforcement was less intense.\n\nWhile these factors played significant roles, it's important to note that many serial killers were eventually caught and brought to justice, often due to diligent police work, advancements in technology, and changing social attitudes.",
    "generator_1":"gpt4_0613",
    "dataset":"helpful_base",
    "output_2":"There are a few reasons why some serial killers were able to evade capture for long periods in the 1970s and 1980s:\n\n- Lack of coordination between law enforcement agencies - Information was not shared well across jurisdictional boundaries, allowing killers to more easily escape detection by moving around.\n\n- Less advanced forensic technology - DNA testing, for example, was not developed until the 1980s. Things like blood typing and fingerprint analysis existed but were less sophisticated.\n\n- No centralized database - The FBI's Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (ViCAP) database was not established until 1985. This made it much harder to connect crimes across states. \n\n- Less media coverage - News did not spread as fast or to as wide an audience compared to today. This made it harder for the public to be on alert.\n\n- Killers exploiting transient\/high-risk populations - Many targeted prostitutes, runaways, and others living on the margins of society whose disappearances were less likely to be thoroughly investigated.\n\n- Some degree of chance - Serial killers like Ted Bundy and Gary Ridgway were active for so long in part due to luck in avoiding witnesses, destroying evidence, or having victims not believed.\n\nSo in short, a combination of less coordination, technology, information sharing, and targeted victims created an environment where serial killers could sometimes stay undetected for years. Improved law enforcement and forensic science made this much harder by the 1990s.",
